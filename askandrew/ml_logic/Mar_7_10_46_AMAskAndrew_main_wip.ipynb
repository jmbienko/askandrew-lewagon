Of course that never happens to me, but it may happen to you. Of course it happens to me, but the idea is to stay calm in your mind so that then you can regulate your action. And so I think that there are these practices that one can develop over time that are really straightforward and zero cost. You could find any number of ways to increase your adrenaline and stay calm, and we tend to focus on things like exercise as the way that we get our energy up. But today again, I'm talking about deliberately increasing adrenaline while staying calm mentally, because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events, through things that we didn't seek out.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/larshofferbert/code/hofferBERT/askandrew_langchain/docs/Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System.txt'}),\n",
